# reactive-site

Author: Shane Kennedy

Languages: HTML, CSS

Purpose: I created this page for an assignment for my web development class. I got a bit too interested in how reactive sites worked and wanted to create a basic template to get a feel for how the reactive sites work. Overall, from working on this project, I can say that I still need to do a lot of work with rem and em because I first tried creating this based on those measurements, and later had to change to vw and vh.

Why is there no real content? 
Like I said, this was for an assignment, so I added content to the project I turned in, but this a basic template that I wanted to be able to be adapted into varying circumstances.
